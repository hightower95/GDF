Greetings - welcome to the GD mission framework.

The intent of the framework is to add a number of little details which enhance arma 3 gameplay, and reduce the time it takes to create missions.

This framework consists of a number of parts:

- briefing
    : All of the text supporting the mission. Edit this to tell players what they need to do.
- config
    : A number of options for editing how the various framework scripts will behave - as well as influencing behaviour of mods
- f 
    : The functions which do the work of the framework.
- loadout
    : Date behind loadouts - allowing switching between mods for a mission
- description.ext
    : This is a standard arma 3 file - it links a number of files together.
- onPlayerKilled.sqf
    : When a player dies, the arma 3 engine runs this.
- onPlayerRespawn.sqf
    : When a player respawns, the arma 3 engine runs this.

The structure above is used to make mission creation as simple as it can be for the novice coder. The novice coder does not need to peer into 'f' to set up the mission - it is presumed that only the 'briefing' and 'config' sections need to be edited.

Various checks have been added to highlight to the user when code issues have been detected. These are extremely primitive and incomplete. It is extremely easy for the novice coder to make a mistake and for it not to be obvious. Missing functionality is a dead giveaway that a mistake has been made somewhere.

This framework creates a high degree of flexibility - and by default will try to take strain from the mission creator. It will automatically do loadouts / tfar frequencies. The mission creator must 'opt-out' of these scripts. This is easy to do - check the config folder for further instructions. If you are unsure - just ask. 

To use the framework simply copy and paste the above listed files and folders into your mission folder. Ignore any .sqm files or other .sqf files which are not mentioned above. 

If you find an issue or wish to alter the framework - let someone know!
