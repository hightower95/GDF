To make it easy to keep up to date with the latest framework changes do the following:

Leave everything as default, but:
You want git added to path, and available via right click.

https://git-scm.com/download/win


Inside this folder right click in an empty spot and click on 'git bash here'
A terminal window will open.


Type 'git init' press enter.

Type 'git remote add origin https://github.com/hightower95/GDF.git'

Type 'git remote -v'.
The screen should output:
origin  https://github.com/hightower95/GDF.git (fetch)
origin  https://github.com/hightower95/GDF.git (push)

If it doesnt something has gone wrong. 

If it does you have added the framework successfully.

Now you may type 'git pull origin master'

The framework will appear as if by magic.
